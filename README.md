##Make sure you have a github account

##Software Requirements

* You should be using a ruby version manager (i'd recommend rvm)
* You should have a copy of ruby 1.9.3 at patch level of at least 429

##Getting Started

* Fork this repository on github
* Clone your fork of this repository into your home folder
* Open up a terminal session and run the following commands:

      ``` ruby
      cd [folder your clone copy is in]
      ./run_first
      ./start_new_excercise
      bundle exec rspec spec/**/*.rb
      ```

* After the last command your output should look similar to the following (unecessary output has been omitted):

    ```bash
    .......
